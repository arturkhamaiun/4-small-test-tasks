### Task
A question:
Would you use a class/library provided by an external framework in your code, why or why not?

### Answer
I think adding the whole framework to a project in order to use just some class/library from that framework is redundant, but the most popular frameworks consist of independent components, so there is no need to import the whole framework.

If framework is already used in the project, then I think it's ok.
